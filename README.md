# vue-chat-app

Making a little chat app to learn Vuejs. 
The idea came when I tried to made just a simple "to-do-list", but just for a few more steps I can make my very first chat app so why not.
Hope you can find an inspiration for your next "self-taught" project and feel free to get the code if you need the css.


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

Have fun
